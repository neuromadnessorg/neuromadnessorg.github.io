Recently, mainstream media outlets have been bombing the internet quite a lot with many articles blaming Coconut Oil for many of your health problems.
<br />
With devastating headlines such as "Coconut oil isn't healthy. It's never been healthy", it's quite clear that what we are seeing here is industry funded premium articles
 promoting the <strong>already debunked<sup>[1]</sup></strong> idea that Saturated Fats are harmful for the health, shifting the focus from added sugars.
 [Virgin] Coconut Oil has been shown to have antimicrobial activity<sup>[2]</sup>, to be a great antioxidant<sup>[3]</sup>, and even there is anecdotal evidence that it has been useful both topically and ingested for horrible diseases such as ALS<sup>[4][5][6]</sup>

 A great take on the issue, by the wery well respected Neurologist Dr. Perlmutter can be found in here: [Is Coconut Oil still healthy?, the trust behind the recent headlines](http://www.drperlmutter.com/is-coconut-oil-still-healthy-the-truth-behind-the-recent-headlines/)
